SOME AI PROMPTS FOR LEARNING SOMETHING NEW WITH AI TOOLS


I want to learn [X]. Please create a comprehensive study plan following the 80-20 rule, focusing on the core 20% of concepts that will allow me to start building projects. The plan should be structured week by week for [Y] weeks, with each week covering specific topics.

After the [Y]-week core learning period, please suggest 5 projects of increasing difficulty (from beginner to advanced) that will help me apply and expand my knowledge of [X]. For each project, provide a brief description and list the key concepts it will help reinforce.

Please ensure the plan is detailed enough for a beginner to follow, but also challenges me to think and problem-solve independently.



I'm learning about [Y] in [X]. Please provide:

1. A concise explanation of [Y], including its purpose and when it's commonly used.

2. A simple code example demonstrating [Y].

3. Three common mistakes or misconceptions beginners often have about [Y], and how to avoid them.

4. Two real-world applications or scenarios where [Y] is particularly useful.

5. Three progressively challenging exercises that will help me practice using [Y]. Please don't provide solutions, only the problem statements.

After providing this information, please ask me a thought-provoking question about [Y] that will encourage me to think deeper about its applications or implications.



I'm about to start working on [X], which involves [Y]. My current skill level in [Z] is [beginner/intermediate/advanced]. Please provide:

1. A high-level overview of the main components or features this project should have.

2. A suggested project structure, including main files or modules I'll need to create.

3. Three key challenges I might face while building this project and general strategies to overcome them (without specific code solutions).

4. Two stretch goals I could aim for to make the project more complex once I've completed the basic functionality.

5. Three important concepts or skills from [Z] that this project will help me reinforce or learn.

Please phrase your response in a way that guides my thinking without providing explicit solutions. I want to be challenged to figure out the implementation details on my own.
